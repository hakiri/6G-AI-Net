    <h2>IEEE 6G AI-NET 2024</h2>
    <p>
        The forthcoming 6th Generation (6G) wireless mobile network is poised for remarkable growth in the coming decade, more demanding than those of previous 5th generation (5G)  networks, driven by the insatiable demand for ultra-fast and high-capacity wireless connectivity, promising 100 times peak bandwidth that facilitates high-fidelity immersive extended reality experiences, enable vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication for autonomous driving, and establish extremely dense wireless connectivity. We expect new services ranging from a small group of users, such as self-assembling robots, wearables, body and brain-machine interactions, to mass-market services, such as mixed holographic reality, cellular-connected drones, autonomous supply chain, metaverse and massive twinning. 
        The 6G will also be incorporating non-terrestrial networks, by providing significant enhancements of Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity through Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations and High-Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS), which will expand the connectivity of IoT devices beyond terrestrial constraints. Such services impose high-performance, reliability, and consistency requirements.

    <!--  <h2>Camera-ready Instructions</h2>
    <h3>LaTeX Instructions</h3>
    <p>
    <h4>Template:</h4> Please use the sigconf proceedings template from the ACM Master article template for LaTeX (acmart class) for
    your submission (under the LaTeX Authors section). Please follow the instructions given on the page, and please have a
    look / start from the sample file “sample-sigconf.tex” in the acmart package. Even if you have already downloaded the
    package for another conference, you should download it again as ACM often makes changes to their template and publishes
    new versions. If you submit a paper using an outdated version of the template, you might be required to update to a
    newer version.</p>
    <p>
    <h4>Fonts:</h4>     Type 1 or TrueType fonts must be used (this will usually happen by default). Type 3 fonts are not permitted.
    TrueType fonts are permitted, but will be tested for any problems which may need to be rectified. For help on obtaining
    the correct type of fonts, see this hint in the ACM FAQ list. Note: in rare cases, PDFs generated with pdflatex will not
    contain embedded fonts. This most often occurs when vector images included in paper do not themselves embed their fonts.
    If we find problems with your PDF, and you are unable to submit a revised version with correctly embedded fonts, we may
    have to take a less desirable and less safe route: that you submit a PostScript (PS) version, from which we produce PDF.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h4>Camera-ready copyright header: </h4>
    the ACM copyright form will provide a block of LaTeX code to be included in the “Rights
    management information” section of the header. Please double-check that your produced document matches the copyright
    info details found in HotCrp, and that you have included your full DOI URL.

    <span style="color:black; font-size:18px"> Title: Machine Learning in Digital Twin Edge Networks </span>
    <p>In this talk, we mainly introduce our proposed new research
        direction: Digital Twin Edge Networks (DITEN). We first present the
        concept and model related to Digital Twin (DT) and DITEN. Then, we
        focus on new research challenges and results when machine learning
        is exploited in DITEN, including federated learing, deep
        reinforcement learning and transfer learning. DT building, DT
        placement and DT transfer as unique research questions, will be
        defined and analyzed. We are also expecting that the talk will help
        the audience understand the future development of edge computing,
        e.g., digital twin edge networks in the context of Metaverse.</p> -->
